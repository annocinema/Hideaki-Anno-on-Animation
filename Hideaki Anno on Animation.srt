Director Hideaki Anno, who has always been receiving a lot of attention from fans along with Neon Genesis Evangelion

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,800
In the 26th episode "Magokoro wo Kimi ni" released at the theater, he caught the hearts of many fans with his outstanding performance.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What does he have in his mind when making a film?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's that the viewers do not fall asleep.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
How can I avoid the viewers to sleep while watching?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,200
I'm thinking about nothing but that.

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,300
If you want to use CG efficiently, anime-like movies are the best.

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,800
CG is similar to animation, so if you use it in live action it will look more like animation.

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,000
There is not much need to use CG for animation.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
[What is the role of CG in animation production?]
I was able to make animation without CG. I think I'm using it now just because it's novel.

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,000
People who are making anime aren't interested in CG so much.

11
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,400
He released unique images in live-action works as well such as Cutie Honey, which was released recently and became a hot topic, Love & Pop and Shiki-Jitsu.

12
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,000
He is demonstrating his talent by jumping over the genre of anime.

13
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,000
I haven't done tokusatsu in a commercial movie yet, so I want to do a tokusatsu movie.

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:37,200
[What is the difference between anime and live-action production?]
The staff members are in a completely different field.

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Also, between animation and live-action, the flow of time is completely different, so that's a big thing.
